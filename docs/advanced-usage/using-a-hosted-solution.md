The approach of using a `<template>` tag to define OG images inline (so they inherit your page's own CSS, fonts, and Vite assets) is inspired by [OG Kit](https://ogkit.dev) by [Peter Suhm](https://x.com/petersuhm).

If you'd rather not self-host the screenshot infrastructure (Chrome, Browsershot, or Cloudflare Browser Rendering), OG Kit is a great hosted alternative. It uses the same inline-template approach, but handles the screenshot generation for you as a service.
